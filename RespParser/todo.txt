Implement a Resp protocol parser library

The protocol should be parsed as defined in the following url https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/
All models are defined in the RespProtocol project
The parser should have a method that receives a stream of bytes in some form containing one of the resp types, and returns IRespType? (return null only for null bulk strings)
Note that string values are utf8 encoded
If the incoming message is invalid throw an ArgumentException

Priorities:
1. Correctnes for all types except arrays
2. Parsing code is easy to read
3. The parser is be easy to use by the client code
4. Correctness for arrays (Bonus)
5. Correctness for nested arrays (Bonus)
6. Try to use less memory (Bonus)
